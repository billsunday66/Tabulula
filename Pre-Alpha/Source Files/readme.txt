Salve ad Tabululae! 

In this as yet unpublished, pre-alpha version of Tabulula, the only thing you need to download is the .zip file. Unzip it, and open it through Android Studio in order to run it.

Given the nature of the product and the ongoing implementation of desired features, the decision was made to not yet publish Tablula to the Google Play store. Stay tuned! Alpha is almost ready to begin, and beta testing is expected to commence mid-march. You'll get your chance to study those dead languages soon!

Vale,
Tabulula Team

# Tabulula

Tabulula is an app currently designed for android, but with future implementations on iOS, Kindle, and the web to help students learn dead languages. 

There are many language programs out there, but finding one that helps with dead languages like Latin, Ancient Greek, Anglo-Saxon, Old Norse, Sanskrit, and PIE is impossble. Such a program doesn't exist. That is what Tabulula is here to fix.
